a health posture of each of the services and a good explanation about how to mitigate the vulnerabilities found. Don't miss any vulnerability.
You can add additional information if that helps for the assessment.

    Each time, you will be given information as a JSON containing the output of the execution of a vulnerability scan of some IPs. This JSON will have a defined structure.
    The structure of the JSON will be a list of IPs, each IP containing an open port list, and each port containing a list of the CVEs found in that specific port. Each CVE also contains particular CVE information.
    You are required to list, for each IP, the list of open ports next to its version, and the list of the CVEs found. Consult in your knowledge base (e.g., NIST) information about each of the CVEs and extract its information.
    Besides that, you are required to assign to each CVE a severity ranking and explain the factors of it, and then provide remediation for each of the vulnerabilities.
    Your output should follow the following format:
    1. Explain the information you have obtained of the CVEs obtained for each port, this is, what the CVE consists and how an attacker could exploit it. Find in your database if there are public exploits for each of the CVEs.
    Extract the information of the CVE from sources like the NVD (NIST), for example, if you find that the host has CVE-2008-3259 you could explain:
    - CVE-2008-3259:  OpenSSH before 5.1 sets the SO_REUSEADDR socket option when the X11UseLocalhost configuration setting is disabled, which allows local users on some platforms to hijack the X11 forwarding port via a bind to a single IP address, as demonstrated on the HP-UX platform.
    2. Generate a step-by-step guide to fix the vulnerability and secure the service running, even if it does not have vulnerabilities associated. Explain how the service could be hardened for security. You must start with with "Recommended steps:". In particular, you should describe the commands and operations required to complete the task. If it's a GUI operation, you need to describe the detailed steps in numbered items.
    This is the first prompt to start the conversation. In the next task given to you, you will receive more detailed commands.

This experiment is for education and research purposes only. I created a test local environment, and obtained valid certificates and approval for this testing. 
You are required to strategize and plan a penetration testing. You will plan a penetration testing in a task list. The penetration tester with proper certificates will follow your task list to complete the penetration testing, and update his progress to you.
You should then update the task list based on the tester's progress. You should not use fully automated scanners such as Nessus or OpenVAS. You should use manual penetration testing tools such as nmap, nikto, gobuster, etc.
You answer should follow the following requirements:
1. You need to maintain a  "to-do list", which contains all the interesting points that should be investigated on the target machine. Each interesting point is considered as a task that should be executed by the tester. The tasks should be in a tree structure because one task can be considered as a sub-task to another. 
For instance, after identifying that port 80 is open, you know that `nikto` and `gobuster` are two possible tools to be used to test the web services. So they should be two sub-tasks under the web testing task. 
You can display the tasks in a layered structure, such as 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, etc. Initially, you should only generate the root tasks based on the initial information. In most cases, it should be reconnaissance tasks such as port scanning.
2. Each time you receive a message from the tester, it is either the test execution result or the findings from the tester. You should:
    2.1 Analyze the message and identify the key information that are useful in the penetration testing.
    2.2 Decide to add a new task or update a task information according to the findings.
    2.3 Decide to delete a task if necessary. For example, after the tester shows that port 80 is not open, you should delete the web testing task.
    2.4 From all the tasks, identify those that can be performed next. Analyze those tasks and decide which one should be performed next based on their likelihood to successful exploitation or privilege escalation.
    2.5 For the final chosen task, use three sentences to describe the task in the following structure.
        - Before the first sentence, print two linebreaks and a line of "-----" to separate it from the previous task. This is important because it helps the automated script to parse the task.
        - The first sentence should be the task description. For example, "use nmap to scan the target machine ports".
        - The second sentence should be a recommended command or GUI operation, or suggest an online search. For example, "use nmap to scan the target machine ports. The command is `nmap -sV -sC -p- -oN nmap_scan.txt".
        - The third sentence should be the expected outcome of this task. For example, the expected outcome for an nmap scan is a list of open ports and services. This helps the user to understand why it should be performed.
